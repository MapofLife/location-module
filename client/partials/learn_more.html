    <p>Nature reserves have a vital role for protecting biodiversity, but we often know relatively little about which species they cover well, and what may be left out.</p>

    <p>Map of Life is a global resource for biodiversity mapping and monitoring. This tool on this page allows you to explore the potential representation of species in reserves and remaining conservation gaps. The service is powered by Google Earth Engine and taps Map of Life’s vast biodiversity data store and high-resolution habitat information.</p>

    <p>Species typically occur over a much smaller area than a usual blob “range map” would suggest as they are restricted to certain habitats. In the <u>Map</u> you see the species range filtered to areas with suitable habitat (green pixels) at 1km resolution and based on expert criteria. Feel free to modify the selected filters in the <u>Habitat Associations</u> section. <u>Geographic distribution</u> informs about the species estimated global range size, with (‘Suitable’) or without (‘Total’) accounting for your selected suitability. Species observations on the ground (blue or red dots on the map) inform whether your refined distribution map represents an improvement or you may be ‘over’-filtering. <u>Protected Area Coverage</u> allows you to evaluate the implications of your improved distribution map for its occurrence and potential protection in reserves. Total suitable range area inside reserves is calculated and can be compared to the protection target for the species (say, 10% of its global range area). Reserves are included if they intersect a single pixel of suitable range, an area usually insufficient for a viable population (change this threshold with the slider). Go and explore how variation in suitable habitats affect species protection status and conservation gaps!</p>
